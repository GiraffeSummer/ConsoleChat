# ConsoleChat

This is a dumb project I worked on to learn.
And just to see if I could get it to work.


start with `npm start`


build with `npm run build`
  

feel free to check out the scripts to see the console arguments.

But some examples of console arguments are:
 - **mode** - used to launch client or server mode (ex: `mode=2` < for server)
 - **port** - used to set server port, if this and mode is set it will auto launch the server (ex: `port=3000`)
 - **uri** - used to set the client connection uri, this will automatically launch and connect the client if mode is also set.
